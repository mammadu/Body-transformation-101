# Body-transformation-101

This document is the accumulation of my learnings on fat loss and building muscle

## Body transformation overview

### What is a body transformation

- In this presentation, a body transformation is a redefinition of your physique according to your goals
- This typically includes fat loss and building muscle

### Why do a body transformation

- Some people want to look like their favorite athlete
- Some people want to perform athletic feats their body can't currently do
- Some people just want to be healthier

## Fat Loss

- Fat loss allows you to reveal your physique!
- To lose fat you must
  - Have a clear weight loss goal
  - Have an adequate diet
  - Have an adequate workout plan
  - Stay consistent

### Setting your weight loss goal

- How much weight should I lose?
  - Whatever the doctor says
  - BMI
  - Body fat percentage

#### BMI

- BMI is determined using weight and height
- BMI = weight(kg) / [height(cm)]^2 = weight(lbm) / [height(in)]^2 * 703
- BMI is simple to calculate but doesn't take into account lean body mass - muscle weighs more than fat
  - For example, body builders will have a higher BMI than someone of the same height
- Healthy BMI ranges from 18.5 â€“ 24.9

##### Goal weight from BMI

1. Determine height
2. Determine BMI goal
3. Goal weight = BMI goal * [height(cm)]^2 = BMI goal * [height(in)]^2 / 703

- Example:
  - BMI goal = 25
  - height = 70 inches
  - Goal weight = 25 * 70^2 / 703 = 174.5

4. ...Or just use an online calculator to get your goal weight

#### Body fat percentage

- Determined using lean body mass and total body mass
- Body fat percentage = 1 - (lean body mass)/(total body mass)
- Isn't affected as much by high or low amounts of muscle
- Can be used to estimate body fat of people of interest
- Typically more difficult to measure

##### Goal weight from body fat percentage

- Determine current body fat percentage/lean body mass
- Determine body fat percentage goal
- Determine goal weight

##### How to measure body fat percentage

1. Body fat scale
2. Tape measure
3. Body fat caliper
4. DEXA Scan

##### Determing body fat percentage goal

- [insert picture of different bodyfat percentages]

##### Determining goal weight

- Goal weight = (Lean body mass)/(1 - body fat percentage goal)
- Example:
  - Lean body mass = 150
  - Body fat goal = 15%
  - Goal weight = (150)/(1-15%) = 176.5

### Setting up your diet and workout - CICO

- CICO stands for Calories In vs Calories Out
- For weight loss, CI < CO
- CI is determined by what your diet
- CO is determined by TDEE

#### CI for fat loss

##### What is the best diet?

- The best diet is whatever you can stick to. Diets aren't short term but lifestyle changes.
- As long as CI < CO, you will lose weight.
- Make sure that whatever diet you pick is well balanced for macro and micro nutrients
- Example diets
  - If it fits your macros (IIFYM)
  - Keto
  - Mediterranean
  - Pescatarian
  - Vegan

##### Modifying your diet for weight loss

- Each pound of bodyfat is approximately 3500 calories. 3500 calories / 7 days a week = 500 calories per day
- If your daily CI is 500 calories less than your daily CO, you will lose 1 pound per week. This is a "calorie deficit" of 500 calories
  - The greater your calorie deficit, the faster your weight loss
- This can be accomplished in a variety of ways
  - decreasing your portion sizes
  - removing a meal
  - eating voluminous but low calorie foods
  - etc.
- Make sure your diet modifications are sustainable.
  - If you can only manage CO - CI = 100 that is ok. This is a marathon, not a sprint
  - Try to make sure your calorie deficit is less than 1000 calories - larger calorie deficits should only be taken according to medical advice or at your own risk!

##### Tips for modifying your diet

- Liquid foods can have a deceptively high calorie count! On the other hand, water is nearly zero calories and can increase satiety
  - Drink less soda/juice/alchol and replace it with water
- Typically, higher protein/fat foods decrease satiety, while eating higher sugar foods may increase satiety.
  - Therefore eat more protein/fat foods and less sugary foods, with moderation
- Restaurant foods are typically calorie dense, especially in the USA.
  - Eat out less and cook more! It's an easy way to lose weight and save money
- Sauces and oils can be calorie dense
  - Decrease your usage of sauces or use the light versions

##### Tracking your diet

- How can you tell how many calories your eating?
  - Most food items have a nutrition label. The calories/serving are typically in the largest font and is the first thing you see.
    - Make sure you fully understand how much is each serving. A food scale can help with this
- It may be helpful to use a diet/calorie tracker to understand your diet.
  - You can get an understanding of caloric intake and macro/micro nutrients.
  - Diet/calorie trackers often have solid numbers to aim for with regards to your nutrition
  - Myfitnesspal is free, easy to use, and has a large database of user-updated food labels.
  - Some may find diet/calorie tracking tedious
    - I recommend tracking your current diet for one week, then tracking your new/updated diet for another week.
- Using the diet modification tips mentioned earlier may allow you to forgo diet/calorie tracking completely

#### CO for fat loss

##### TDEE

- TDEE stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure. It is often used interchangebly with "maintenance/maintenance calories" or CO
- TDEE consists of your basal metabolic expenditure (BME) and energy expenditure due to activity
  - BME is a fancy way of saying how much energy your body uses for daily functioning. Typically, larger people have a higher BME

##### What is my TDEE?

- TDEE is a bit harder to track than caloric intake. Typically one must use a device, app, and/or spreadsheets
  - Essentially you must track your calorie intake vs your weight loss over a period of time.
  - Governing equation: CO - CI = Caloric Deficit => CO = CI + Caloric deficit
  - Example:
    - Given:
      - Rate of weight loss = 1 lbm / week
      - Caloric intake = 2000 calories per day
    - Therefore:
      - Caloric deficit = (1 lbm / week) * (3500 calories / lbm of fat) = 3500 calories per week = 500 Calories per day
      - CO = 2000 + 500 = 2500 calories
- There are many devices tha estimate energy expenditures from workouts - fitbit for example.
- Some apps can determine your TDEE for you: "Adaptive TDEE Calculator" for example

##### Small plug

- Adaptive TDEE Calculator draws weight and calorie information from Google fit
  - Unfortunately most calorie trackers don't upload calorie information to google fit - in particular, myfitnesspal.
- To solve this issue, I'm working on a program to scrape myfitnesspal information and upload it to google fit. It is still a work in progress...
  - Current state
    - Program is able to scrape and store data from myfitnesspal
    - I've determined how to collect information from google fit
  - Currently working on
    - converting scraped data into valid format for google fit
    - Uploading data to proper location on google fit
- [Insert github link here]

##### Increasing your TDEE

- Having higher amounts of muscle may increase your BME - however, increasing muscle mass takes a significant amount of time
- Increasing your level of activity is the easiest way to increase your TDEE. There are a variety of ways to accomplish this
  - Use stairs instead of escalators/elevators
  - Walk to a location instead of driving
  - Workout
  - etc

##### What is the best workout?

- The best workout is whatever you can stick to
- As long as CI < CO you will lose weight
- Example workouts
  - Walking (Aerobic)
  - Running (Aerobic)
  - Swimming (Aerobic)
  - Sports (Aerobic/Anaerobic)
  - Weight lifting (Anaerobic)

##### Workout tips

- Working out is much harder than controlling your diet. That is why diet is covered first!
  - 100 calories is approximately equivalent to running 1 mile. It is much easier to not eat a cookie (200 calories) than it is to run 2 miles.
- Working out can allow you to eat more...
  - Don't eat back all the calories you burned - this is an easy way to spin your wheels
- Make sure to include adequate amounts of rest and stretching - this helps to avoid pain and injury
- Stay hydrated! Dehydration can make you dizzy and tired, making the workout difficult
- Aerobic (Cardio) activities typically burn more calories per workout
- Anaerobic (muscle building) typically increase your BME

### Fat loss summary

- Determine your goal weight
- Calories In < Calories Out (CI < CO) is the governing equation for weight loss. The greater the calorie deficit, the faster the weight loss
- Eat less to decrease your CI
- Be more active to increase you CO

## Build Muscle

- To build muscle you must
  - Have an adequate diet
  - Have an adequate workout plan
  - Stay consistent

### CICO for building muscle

- To build muscle, CI >= CO; Your will be eating at maintenance or at a "caloric surplus"
  - Your body will need to convert excess calories into muscle
  - The greater your caloric surplus, the faster you will build muscle... but you will gain more fat too
  - People with higher percentages of bodyfat may be able to gain muscle with a caloric deficit
    - The body will draw the excess calories from the excess fat.
  - I recommend starting at maintenance then increase the caloric surplus enough to gain muscle/properly recover

#### Diet for building muscle

##### Macro and Micro nutrients

- Every food item has macro and micro nutrients
  - Macro nutrients consist of carbohydrates, fat, and protein.
  - Micro nutrients consist of vitamins and minerals (Vitamins A,B,C, calcium, iron, etc)

###### Macro nutrients

- Protein
  - Muscles are made of protein - therefore, having enough protein intake is important for building muscle!
    - To build muscle, it is recommended that you have 0.8g-1.0g of protein per pound of bodyweight
    - Example:
      - Weight = 200 lbm
      - Recommend protein intake = 160g to 200g of protein
    - Meat often has a high amount of protein per serving. Chicken has some of the highest protein/calorie of any food item
    - Some vegetarian options for protein include
      - Tofu
      - Seitan
      - Egg
      - Legumes (Peanuts, lentils, etc)
      - Greek Yogurt
    - Sometimes it's hard to get enough protein in your diet - use protein shakes to increase your intake!
- Fat
  - Fat is important for hormone production
  - It is recommended to get around 15% - 30% of your caloric intake from fat
- Carbohydrates
  - Carbohydrates are a source of quicky energy for your body. This is particularly import in explosive activities like weightlifting.
  - Once you have determined your protein and fat needs, fill the rest of your daily calories with carbohydrates.

###### Micronutrients

- Macronutrients help with daily body functioning. A diet with properly tuned macro nutrients will usually provide proper amounts of micronutrients.
- Using diet trackers like myfitnesspal can help with tracking your micronutrients. More restrictive diets like keto or veganism will require more attention to micronutrient intake.

###### Supplements

- It is recommended to get as much of the macro and micro nutrients from food as possible - sometimes this can be difficult.
- Supplements often can help fill the gaps.
- Caffeine is useful for providing energy throughout the workout
- Creatine assists in ATP creation - it is one of the most widely researched lifting supplements
- Protein shakes often help getting enough protein intake.
- Multivitamins help fill the gaps in your micro nutrients

#### Muscle building fundamentals

- Muscle is built when enough of a stimulus is applied to tear the muscles down.
- Given proper nutrient intake and adequate rest, muscles will rebuild to better handle the stimulus
- This creates a cycle
  - Apply a stimulus to break down muscle
  - Build more muscle
  - Apply more stimulus to break down muscle
  - Repeat

##### Resistance training

- The stimulus to build muscle is typically through resistance training
- Resistance training is done by forcing the muscle to work against some load or resistance
- There are many ways to create the resistance
  - Bodyweight training (Calisthenics)
  - Weightlifting
  - Resistance bands
  - Sandbags
  - etc.

##### Progressive overload

- The cycle of increasing the stimulus to build more muscle is called progressive overload.
- The stimulus can be any number of variables
  - Number of sets
  - Number of reps per set
  - Amount of resistance applied
  - Amount of time under resistance
- Progressive overloading also allows you to track your progress over time.

##### Workout plans

- One of the easiest ways to build muscle is to follow a workout plan.
  - There are a variety of plans to follow online for any skill level
  - You can also join a gym or get a personal trainer to tailor a workout to your needs
  - Going through the plan helps you understand how to make your own workouts

- If you want to look like a boxer, follow a boxer workout plan. If you want to look like a ballet dancer, follow a ballet dancer workout plan etc.

- The best workout is the one you will stick to!
  - Some workouts benefit different muscles at different rates - this does not matter if you're unwilling to stick to the workout
  - If you find a muscle lacking, but you don't enjoy the given workout for that muscle, find a substitute workout. There are many ways to apply a load to a muscle

- Example workout plans
  - Stronglifts 5x5
  - Jim Wendlerâ€™s 5/3/1
  - nSuns LP
  - Reddit Bodywieght fitness Recommended Routine

### Build muscle summary

- CI >= CO to build muscle
- Protein is very important! Get 0.8g-1.0g per pound of bodyweight
- Apply resistance training and progressive overloading to build muscle
- Pick a workout plan you like!

## Note about mental health during body transformation

- Professional athletes, bodybuilders, and celebrities have vast resources and time to put into creating amazing physiques
- Some athletes and bodybuilders use PEDs
- Celebrities may have had surgeries
- You most likely have less resources and time... and that's ok
- Comparing yourself against others can be mentally/emotionally draining.
- Remember, love yourself and your body throughout the process
- The journey of self improvement should itself be admired

## High level summary

- Body transformation is typically done by losing fat and building muscle
- Fat loss
  - Determine your goal weight
  - Calories In < Calories Out (CI < CO) is the governing equation for weight loss. The greater the calorie deficit, the faster the weight loss
  - Eat less to decrease your CI
  - Be more active to increase you CO
